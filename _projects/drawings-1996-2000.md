This was a very productive time for me in the land of drawing. I found that gouache and pen and ink (and sometimes in combination) could provide a substitute for oil on canvas and was way to more quickly explore new subject matter. Part of the project here is to call into question the concept and activity of painting, with the ultimate motive of "hanging" and all that that entails. The works here reference G-d, history and the intimate narratives that take place between the two, consciously and covertly. These drawings are very personal but also are an attempt at connecting up with and floating on a deep stream of Jewish visual history.
