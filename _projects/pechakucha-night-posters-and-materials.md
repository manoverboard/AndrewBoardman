I served on the board of the provincial chapter of the Society of Graphic Designers of Canada ([GDC](https://gdc.design "GDC HQ")) beginning in 2008. When a colleague of mine suggested we bring [PechaKucha Night](https://www.pechakucha.com "PKN HQ") to Winnipeg in the year 2011, I as well as a a number of other board members decided to help make this happen.
