project-excerpt: These are a series of ink drawings on tracing paper done between
  1998 and 2000. These reflect human traces in the form of cartoons, corporate identities
  and manuals prior to the Second World War combined to create a new meaning. I made
  these to see how some of the Jewish and Polish and German and American visual vernacular
  might work together.
