project-excerpt: These are a series of ink drawings on tracing paper done between
  1994 and 1995. These reflect human traces in the form of cartoons, corporate identities
  and manuals prior to the Second World War combined to create a new meaning. I made
  these to see how some of the Jewish and Polish and German and American visual vernacular
  might work together.
meta-description: A series of drawing on tracing paper about the collision of Jewish
  ephemeral culture that itself becomes ephemeral in the collision with commercial
  culture.

A series of drawing on tracing paper about the collision of Jewish ephemeral culture that itself becomes ephemeral in the collision with commercial culture. Most of these works were done in Krakow, Poland during a year that I spent studying art and visual culture on a Fulbright Fellowship. It was an extraordinary year as an artist, not least because of the sheer volume of ephemera, imagery and other material available to me because of my travels throughout Eastern Europe. These drawings are done on tracing paper, a kind of skin upon which I could draw. Each of these traces reflect a kind of emerging language that presents a field of vision when Yiddish culture in the form of newspaper cartoons collided with a broader commercial culture that led to the former's literal demise. These works mark the begin of yet another end of social innocence.
