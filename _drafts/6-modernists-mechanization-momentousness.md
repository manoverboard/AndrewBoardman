In the late 19th century, Paul Cézanne showed us that the world was not composed of a singular vantage point: one all-seeing focused gaze from one particular perspective and one exact moment in time. Instead, the world is replete with an endless set of times and places and our sensibilities and perception are fundamentally altered by the objects that appear before us. The light reflecting off the hills in a painting like _La Montagne Sainte-Victoire_ is not only a pictorial description of how those hills looked at the time that Cézanne saw them. The painting is also a means to describe the complexity of our relationship with the underlying reality of the world. Light moves forward and backward across hills and trees. Space is interrupted by clouds and leaves and by the paint itself. Time itself is pushed and pulled through the shadows on buildings, the highlighted brush strokes and the collapse of pigment upon itself.

When we view a relative unspoiled environment like this, it is easy to see what Cézanne saw. Before us is a landscape of possibilities with masses of objects clumped together made up of smaller elements. A slight turn of the head changes perspective dramatically. The push and pull of color overlaps everywhere and all at once. Time speeds up and stands still and becomes transparent to us. Time and space are seen and then unseen.  Cézanne recorded this perspective in its multiplicity for us.

Pablo Picasso studied Cézanne diligently and later digested the lessons of Cézanne’s multifarious world replete with texture and subtlety. But Picasso was also forced to take everything one step further. By the early 20th century, landscapes in Europe were becoming increasingly divided into countries, cities, towns, provinces, states, and counties through roads, farms, factories and the massive new levers of industry. Machines began to dominate the experience of our environment. Early modernists like Picasso offered up a very different mechanism of viewing the world. Speed and agility and transportation split the landscape into an ever diminishing system of pieces, tightly connected but sprawling and impossible to tie together. The Futurists and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti called it: “A new beauty has been added to the splendor of the world — the beauty of speed.”

By 1908, Picasso and Braque had together fully incorporated the complexity of Cézanne’s vision of nature with their shimmering  new slices of mechanization and modernity. In a few fell swoops, Picasso and Braque brought us Cubism, a description of nature that sacrifices the direct perception of landscape on the chopping block of what is now the built environment. Their planes of light and colour are no longer reflections of the world that is; instead, they are meditations on the mechanization that will be. Their paintings of [people, landscapes and objects]() show a refracted and far more limited vantage point — the eyes of a person in the maw of the machine.

A few years later, painters like Stuart Davis showed us what the world looks like, [this time flat](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/10/13/stuart-davis-full-swing-made-it-american/ "ny books"). His paintings further landscaped the American natural environment and divvied it up into shapes, sections and sub-sections that reflect an environment now almost full segmented by industry, cities, suburbs and agriculture. For Davis, planes are demarcated by lines and lines are segmented by colour. It all adds up to a panoply of a forms representing a built environment that is whole only because we made it so.

Unlike our friend Cézanne, Davis records an environment that is sectioned, cordoned, halved, quartered and eighthed. It is a paint-by-numbers world. And to a very large extent, it is the world that most of us see right now.

And yet, we should always remember Cézanne’s pre-industrial depictions of a landscape not quite partitioned. Underneath the mechanization of the land and the totalizing presence of modernity, there is a place that is not so regimented and not dominitable nor divisible. That place is still there, below it all and findable if we make the time.
