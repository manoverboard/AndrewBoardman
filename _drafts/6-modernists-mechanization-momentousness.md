excerpt: Cézanne showed us that the world was not composed of a singular vantage point
  — that our environment is a panoply of times and spaces.  Despite massive mechanization
  and industrialization, we can still experience that landscape of shimmering possibility.

In the late 19th century, Paul Cézanne showed us that the world was not composed of a unified vantage point with a single and particular perspective of physical space and time. Instead, the world is replete with an endless set of places and times and our own sensibilities and perception are  altered by the objects appearing before us. The shimmering light reflecting off the hills in a painting like _La Montagne Sainte-Victoire_ (above) is not only a pictorial description of how those hills may have looked at the time that Cézanne saw them. The painting is also a means to describe the complexity of our relationship with the underlying reality of the world. Light moves forward and backward across hills and trees. Space is interrupted by clouds and leaves and by the paint itself. Time itself is pushed and pulled through the shadows on buildings, the highlighting and brush strokes and the collapse of pigment upon itself.

The painting depicts a moment in time by calling attention to the painting of time itself.

When we view a relatively unspoiled environment in this painting, it is easy to think we see what Cézanne saw. Before us is a landscape of possibilities with masses of objects clumped together made up of smaller elements drafted across time. A slight turn of the painter's head would change perspective dramatically. The push and pull of color overlaps everywhere and sometimes all at once. Time speeds up and stands still and becomes transparent. The passage of time and the experience of space are seen and then unseen. Cézanne recorded perspective as a perspective. And I would suggest that this was easier to do before industrialization set in and landscapes were heavily modified by machinery and agriculture.

Pablo Picasso studied Cézanne diligently and later digested the lessons of Cézanne’s depicted space replete with texture and subtlety. But Picasso was also forced to take everything one step further. By the early 20th century, landscapes in Europe were becoming increasingly divided into countries, cities, towns, provinces, states, and counties through roads, farms, factories and new layers of industry. Machines began to dominate the experience of our environment. Early modernists like Picasso would offer up a very different means of viewing the world. Speed and agility and transportation split the landscape into an ever diminishing system of pieces, tightly connected but sprawling and impossible to tie together as Cézanne had one. The Futurists and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti called it: “A new beauty has been added to the splendor of the world — the beauty of speed.”

By 1908, Picasso and Georges Braque had together fully reified Cézanne’s vision of nature with their slivers and slices of form, inducing what would become visual modernity. In those few fell swoops, Picasso and Braque brought us Cubism, a description of nature that sacrifices a totalizing perception of the natural landscape, depicting what we now call the built environment. Their planes of light and colour were no longer reflections of the world that was (and is); instead, they are meditations on the mechanization that will be. Picasso and Braque's early Cubist paintings of [people, landscapes and objects]() show a refracted and more limited vantage point, from the eyes of a singular subject in the maw of the machine.

A few years later, painters like Stuart Davis showed us what the world looks like again, [this time flat](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/10/13/stuart-davis-full-swing-made-it-american/ "ny books")tened. His paintings showed the American natural environment, divided into shapes, sections and sub-sections that reflect a now fully populated environment segmented by industry, cities, suburbs and agriculture. For Davis, the natural world is no longer natural; the landscape is demarcated by lines and lines are segmented by colour. His paintings add up to a panoply of shapes that only represent a built environment that is whole because we made it so.

Unlike our friend Cézanne, Davis records an environment that is sectioned, cordoned, halved, quartered and eighthed. It is a paint-by-numbers world, cordoned off and segmented and striated. And to a very large extent, it is the world that most of us experience right now.

And yet, we might remember that Cézanne’s pre-industrial depictions of a landscape are not gone. Underneath the division and mechanization of the land and the presence of modernity, there is an earth less regimented and not divisible. It's still there, beneath everything, and findable if we make the time.
