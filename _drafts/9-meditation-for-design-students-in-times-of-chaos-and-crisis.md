I have been introducing my design students to meditation in my classes over the past few years. When we were in person, in the classroom, I would begin by presenting a short series of slides and videos to address why paying closer attention to the particular moment is important and why a deliberate practice of meditation can be beneficial. During this last fall semester, it did not feel important. It felt critical.

The pandemic has taken a toll on so many: the elderly in particular as well as those from our most vulnerable populations, including the poor, those from Indigenous communities and those are racialized or otherwise disenfranchised. But the toll on college and university students goes largely unseen and underreported. (Even before the pandemic, one researcher found that "50 per cent of students felt so depressed that it was difficult to function".) The vast majority of students in my classes are going to school while also working a part-time or even full-time job. Under the pandemic, most of the students lost their jobs temporarily or permanently. They moved back home if they could. Some are cut off from their families in other provinces, states or countries. And students that suffered anxiety, depression or other mental illness had it even harder as social isolation exacerbated their emotional distress and insecurity.

We were also meeting inside a 13.3” laptop monitor (or worse a 3.4” smartphone). While I did my very best to deliberately build community among the 20 students in the course — through check-ins at the beginning of class, breakout rooms during class, and collaborative reading groups outside of class — the reality is that Zoom is still an insufficient simulation for in person connection and the random humour that emerges in real space.

It was the right time to elevate the introduction of quiet meditation to the class. As the literature indicates (stat), even a short mindful practice helps students focus and ground them in the conversation and the work before them. Meditation also provides a shared moment of reflection and quiet that helps connect students with one another and with the space and time at hand. And it provides an alternative mode of processing information while encouraging everyone to realize that they are in this together, at least for the next 2.5 hours.

How did I do it? It is not complicated. On the second day of class, I told students that we were going to have a short, guided meditation at the start of every class. I explained that this was neither a religious exercise nor was it mandatory. I explained that I had no expectation except for one to simply sit. You could keep your eyes open or closed, though closed is generally better at first. And I repeated that this was a completely optional exercise — if it was not to your liking or interest, you could simply do something else for a minute. And of course, there was no grade associated with it! My true goal was to bring everyone into the classroom (albeit virtual) and to ground us for the lecture and conversations ahead.

Then I offered my own guided meditation, as we sat, eyes closed, mind open. One minute.

That’s it. I used a calm bell on an iPhone app to mark the beginning and the end of our work together. And I should note that I spoke quietly and encouragingly to the students over the course of that minute.

Really, that’s everything. During the next few weeks, I continued this mindful minute exercise at the start of every class. Midway through the class, I elongated it from one minute to two. And toward the end of the class, we sat for three minutes. Perhaps for some, that felt like an eternity.

I want to add here that the purpose here is not just to have students “feel better” about themselves, or the class, or me. It’s also not about getting students to behave or to perform better. I’m not interested in meditation as some form of performance drug. And I’m not interested in students being part of a corporatized happiness project, a subject I will discuss later. Rather, the goal is to get students to realize that they are responsible for being in the class, that they are part of something larger, and that, by the law of transitive, they are also responsible for the immediate and greater world they inhabit. The work that needs to get done is too big for us to just jump in without acknowledging each other and our own presence. To be more exact, working to mitigate climate change, improve civil society, demand social justice and build democratic institutions cannot be addressed by saying we’ll just get to it. And while our studio class was built to explicitly address all of these issues, they were part of our conversation throughout.

Meditation is a singular, albeit not the only, means to help one recognize an interconnected nature of reality. That our minds and our bodies are part of an unfolding process — and that we can find the means to control our response to it. It is an answer to the fierce individualism that we experience under capitalism. It allows us to see each other as beings, conscious and connected to the greater world. It opens space for critical thinking, for discovery and for saying yes — as well as no. For this class, with a focus on design criticism and theory, meditation (or the pause of mind) is actually a kind of mediation. It a small stepping stone for which to launch into ideas, images and inference.
