<h1>Guy Maddin’s Big Brain</h1>

<p>I first saw Guy Maddin’s <a href="https://zeitgeistfilms.com/film/careful">Careful</a> in New York around 1993 and I have been hypnotized by him ever since. So entranced, in fact, that my joke is that I ended up moving to Winnipeg (his hometown) and now I get to share the same water supply.</p>

<p>Below is a piece that I <a href="http://www.deckchairs.net/2008/02/brand-on-the-brain/">wrote</a> (February 5, 2008) about <em>Brand Upon the Brain</em>, a performance of the sublime that Maddin orchestrated in Winnipeg ten years ago. I very often think about this performance — the inimitable Isabella Rossellini and those Foley artists, in particular — and I loved writing about it. Sharing this piece again here (with a number edits) gives me a pinch of joy.</p>

<hr />

<p>Tonight, I saw Guy Maddin’s <a href="https://www.criterion.com/films/746-brand-upon-the-brain">Brand Upon the Brain</a>. (Update: this film is the director’s eight feature and the middle film in what Maddin calls the “Me Trilogy”.) As the rappers say, I’m going to break it down because it was perhaps the most coherently incoherent and gorgeous aesthetic spectacle I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>First, let’s try to describe it. Maddin’s work, dark and mossy and fantastic, is often maddeningly difficult to deliberately make understood through prose. </p>

<p><em>Brand Upon the Brain</em> was performed as part of the annual New Music Festival at the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra here in Manitoba. (Update: the film premiered at TIFF in 2006 with a full orchestra, a “castrato”, and Foley artists.) The primary visual focus consisted of a huge screen of Maddin’s visual narrative of a guy named Guy who lives in a lighthouse and pines after his sister’s lesbian friend, despite the fact that that friend plays a man, who goes by the name of Chance and who is not as lovely but is more loving than the sister of Guy the character. Chance, who seems miscast at first (and this is my only critique of the entire performance), turns out to be a key figure in the distraught, anxious, and very unhappy young life of the orphan Guy who, as we watch all 12 chapters begin and end, comes back to visit his once and future home, that being this island with a lighthouse not far from the mainland and which feels very, very isolated.</p>

<p>The mother, through various kinds of sexual and verbal escape, becomes old and young again while the father goes back to work, even as an old man, a naked resurrected corpse, and a young torturer, not necessarily in that order. Meanwhile, the pining Guy is a romantic witness to the unfolding story, occasionally surrounded by imprisoned orphans of numerous races dressed in white. But the narrative itself is the easiest part to tell and, despite the above, it makes sense and holds its own visual logic throughout every Oedipal twist and turn.</p>

<p>The beauty of the piece came with the three live satellite features of the event. The gorgeous and understated Isabella Rossellini narrated the entire drama. Introduced by the charming and gentle Guy Maddin, Rosselini wore a sleek, black, Italian suit which matched her slicked down, curled-out hair, looking as engaged with the drama as she could possibly be, smiling and then scoffing, waving and then yelling. In front of her, she watched the drama unfold on the monitor and her lines were flawlessly read. At one point, she screamed and my brain flew off.</p>

<p>To her right was a ten-piece orchestra, pulled from the fantastic Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra. Their very physical synchronicity with the silent film above them was exacting and it lent the whole affair an emotional air that could never be felt via a soundtrack — despite the fact the score, by Jason Staczek, was masterful. The conductor, Rei Hotoda, was so fully on, so completely engaged with the towering images that the music, when it wasn’t soaring, blended, perfectly, lovingly, joyfully, and near-tearfully.</p>

<p>To the right of the orchestra were the Foley artists; three musician-cum-sound-effect-artists, they played their buckets of water, slamming doors, creaking stairs, screaming babies, rubber chickens, popping bubble wrap, chopped cabbage, crushed celery, electronic horn, smashed cantaloupes, silent clockers, barking foghorns, lapping paper waves, and painted books with panache and sweat-filled attention. (Note: Foley artistry is a beautiful practice in which objective sound effects are produced to create a greater sense of reality or unreality in a film or performance. Here it was both. The technique is named after Jack Foley who worked at Universal Studios in the 1910s). Imagine the Blue Man Group quietly orchestrating a return as normal people who loved the symphony, fresh vegetables, and German Expressionism.</p>

<p>This brings me to the next full-on ramble, which is about Maddin’s glorious imagery. I’m sitting here in jealous, loving rage at the director because I only wish I could make images as beautiful as Maddin does. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lighthouses and rotating periscopic chairs</li>
<li>RCA-brand Victor Talking Machine-era voice-scopes</li>
<li>Major Tom men, as attractively rendered as they are evil</li>
<li>David Bowiesque Pierrot figures, walking amidst lapping waves</li>
<li>Laboratory instruments, framed against a window as continual darkness</li>
</ul>

<p>Aesthetically, Maddin pulled together the very best and disparate strands of one hundred and twenty years of cinema into one, single 94-minute film. Black and white throughout, with touches of harrowing and strangled color, the film calls upon every important Surrealist, Expressionist, Soviet, and American Avant-Garde trope. It does so with a gallows humor and a deep sorrow for the loss of those these types of forms in contemporary imagery. The shapes and shades and shorts make more than a nod to the beauty of simplicity and directness of the emotional content — they resurrect the innocence of the times when films were made to directly impact, and not just manipulate, our empathy for the characters and the mise-en-scene in which they thrive and deny and dream.</p>

<p>The film itself is scratched and dented throughout, as it is often is in Maddin’s work. It’s as if the visual impoverishment of the film stock helps Maddin enrich our own connection and love for the medium. Interestingly, at certain points during the film, strange digital rectangles flickered across the screen, remnants of the modern video medium being broadcast. I don’t know if these are modern-day effects intended by the artist or if they’re reminders of our own media’s near-mortality.</p>

<p>I do know that it was Richard Wagner that coined the phrase <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em>, a total artwork that fulfills every sense and fills every space and every crevice of sensorial perception. The 1980s and the 1990s art world witnessed many attempts at <em>Gesamkuntswerk</em>, what with Day Glo colors and loud voices and bright lights. But Maddin is the only true heir to the Wagnerian form. (Update: He still is.)</p>
