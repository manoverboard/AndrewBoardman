I first saw Guy Maddin’s _Careful_ in New York around 1993 and I have been under the director's spell ever since. So entranced am I, in fact, that I ended up moving to Winnipeg (his hometown) and now I get to share the same water supply.

Below is a piece that I wrote in February 2008 about [Brand Upon the Brain](https://www.criterion.com/films/746-brand-upon-the-brain), a performance that Maddin orchestrated with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra. I very often think about that strange show — the inimitable Isabella Rossellini and those Foley artists, in particular — and I loved writing about it then. Sharing this piece again here (with a number of edits) gives me a hard pinch of joy.

Tonight, I saw Guy Maddin’s <a href="https://www.criterion.com/films/746-brand-upon-the-brain">Brand Upon the Brain</a>. (Update: this film is the director’s eighth feature and the middle film in what Maddin calls the “Me Trilogy”.) As old school rappers might say, I’m going to break it down because it was perhaps the most coherently incoherent and gorgeous aesthetic spectacle I’ve ever seen.

First, let’s try to describe it. Maddin’s work — dark, enigmatic, mossy and fantastical — is often maddeningly difficult to understand as prose alone.

<em>Brand Upon the Brain</em> was performed as part of the annual and renowned New Music Festival at the WSO. \[Update: the film premiered at TIFF in 2006 with a full orchestra, a “castrato”, and Foley artists.\] On the huge screen was a guy named Guy who lives in a lighthouse and pines after his sister’s lesbian friend, despite the fact that that friend plays a man, who also goes by the name of Chance and who is not as lovely, but is more loving, than the sister of Guy who is the character. Chance, who seems somehow miscast at first, turns out to be a key figure in the distraught, anxious, and very unhappy young life of the orphan Guy who, as we watch all twelve chapters begin and end, comes back to visit his once and future home, that being this island with a lighthouse not far from the mainland and which feels very, very, very isolated.

The mother, through various kinds of sexual and verbal escapades, becomes both old and young again while the father goes back to work as an old man and as a naked resurrected corpse and a young torturer. Meanwhile, the pining Guy is a witness to the unfolding story, occasionally surrounded by imprisoned orphans of numerous ethnicities, all of them dressed in white.

The narrative itself somehow makes sense and maintains its own visual logic throughout every twist and turn.

A gorgeous and understated Isabella Rossellini narrated. Introduced by the charming and gentle Guy Maddin, Rosselini wore a sleek, black, Italian suit which matched her slicked down, curled-out hair. She was fully engaged with the story, smiling and then scoffing, waving and then yelling. In front of her, the drama unfolded on the monitor and her lines were flawlessly read. At one point in the evening, she screamed and I think my brain flew off.

To her right was a ten-piece orchestra with musicians pulled from the fantastic Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra. Their synchronicity with the projected silent film above them was perfect. The conductor, Rei Hotoda, was so fully on, so completely engaged with those towering images that the music blended perfectly, lovingly and joyfully.

To the right of the orchestra were our Foley artists; three musician-cum-sound-effect-artists who played buckets of water, slammed doors, creaked stairs, screamed babies, squeaked rubber chickens, popped bubble wrap, chopped cabbage, crushed celery, sounded horns, smashed cantaloupes, tripped foghorns, lapped paper waves, and did it all with a sweat-filled attention to detail. (Foley artistry is a practice in which sounds effects are produced to build a greater sense of reality (or unreality) for a film. It is named after Jack Foley who worked at Universal Studios in the early 1900s).

Matched by sound, there is Maddin’s glorious imagery. Included in the film are:

* Lighthouses and rotating periscopic chairs
* RCA-brand Victor Talking Machine-era voice-scopes
* Major Tom men, as attractively rendered as they are scary
* David Bowiesque Pierrot figures, walking amongst the lapping waves
* Laboratory instruments, framed against a window of darkness

Throughout, Maddin pulled together the very best and disparate strands of one hundred and twenty years of cinema into one, single 94-minute film. Black and white, with touches of slightly strangled color, the film calls upon every important Surrealist, Expressionist, Soviet, and American Avant-Garde trope. And it calls attention to the lost art of film with a gallows humor and an inherently deep sorrow for the loss of those these forms in contemporary film. The mise en scene nods to the beauty, simplicity, and directness of truly emotional content and resurrect a time of innocence, when films were made to influence, and not just manipulate, our empathy for a story's characters.

The film itself is scratched and dented throughout, as it is often is in Maddin’s work. It is as if the  impoverishment of the film stock itself helps Maddin enrich our own connection and love for the medium. Interestingly, at certain points during the film, strange digital rectangles flickered across the screen, remnants of the modern video medium being broadcast. I don’t know if these were intentional or not but they are reminders of our own digital media's mortality, as well.
