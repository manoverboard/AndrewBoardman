What is the gap? Yes, it is a jeans retailer started in San Francisco in 1969, the short name a reference to the large social chasm between boomers and that greatest generation. How can we ever forget that. But for designers and for those seeking to critically engage with the world, the gap is also something else, an epiphenomenon and a socially contracted moment that needs both examination and contemplation.

The gap is everywhere all at once. It is the crack in the armour, the glitch in the matrix, the dim flicker in the stars noticable during a hike beyond our lit cities. The gap is what we see when everything is right but something is off, when we feel not quite right, when the day is not turning out well, when we blame the full moon for our actions and for the actions of others.

The gap is that strange feeling of difference between bodily wellness and discomfort, between kindness and a gentle ribbing, between looking down at a computer and looking up at your child. The gap is that moment, when you’re at a party, between the feeling of confidence while talking with a friend and the feeling of utter self-consciousness when turning to a stranger. The gap is that split second when a piece of paper transforms into a drawing or a letter. The gap is revealed when we lie. The gap is felt when we cry. We see the gap everywhere, all of the time but we may not notice it often. The gap has no positive or negative valence; it is part of the strange condition in which we find ourselves.

The gap is not just an intangibility or a purely psychic phenomenon. It is an object in consciousness to be examined. A gap is a graspable moment in time, or perhaps a physical crease in space, where we can exert our agency and examine those armoured contingencies of everyday life. The gap is something not just worth noting and then going about our own business. The gap is worth knowing in some way. It is an acknowledgement of our closed-mindedness to possibility. The poet and printmaker William Blake once wrote this (oft quoted and misquoted) note:

> “If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.”

> ― William Blake, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (1793)

Blake acknowledges the gap in our constant reception of reality and, in a single act of jujitsu, makes the hard claim that the gap is actually of our own social doing. The gap is always already around us; we are simply not paying attention to what we know that we have created. In this way, the gap is unstable, undetermined — a kind of quantum that has two simultaneous properties: open and closed. Depending upon our position, the gap appears or disappears but it always _is_. 

For designers, when it comes to systems change and inquiry, we can use our experience of the gap to open us up to possibility. How do we examine the gap through the lens of design inquiry? I think we need to take on the mantle of active mindfulness. We need to be present to our indifferences, to our insecurities, to our mild shrugs and our wild moves. We, as designers, need to acknowledge our own misdeeds and our misapprehensions. We need to slough off the sloughing off of responsibilities like accusing our clients of bad faith or blaming our tools for bringing harm to the world.

Active mindfulness is about creating new spaces for dialogue with others, for engaging with those with whom we disagree, and for calling on the carpet those who are damaging our planet. For instance, we can ask our clients hard questions that come from an empathy for their work and a care for their stakeholders. The questions do not have to be complex but they do need to be pointed. “What is your privacy policy?” “How do you intend to engage with the community?” “What ingredients are potentially harmful to the environment and our health?” “What are the criteria you use for hiring?”

We also need to ask these questions of ourselves. “What have we done to erode privacy?” “What is our own engagement with community?” “What tools are we using that are harmful to the environment and our health?” “What are our criteria for client selection?” These kinds of questions reveal the gap in our understanding and experience of the world. 

Active mindfulness is not just about sitting on the cushion, though that is an important part in understanding our underlying connection to all things. Active mindfulness is about becoming aware of the narrow chinks of the cavern and then acting on that awareness. It’s a twofold and dialectical process that can open us to own our work and our relationship with that work.

\----------------

There are three steps. 1. Find a gap in everyday existence. 2. Acknowledge the gap through awareness. 3. Pry the gap open and see what the result is.

The result of opening a gap could be a prank, a gaff, an admonishment or a thread. It could mean staying home in bed for a day or turning something against itself.

Another example from history that is more theoretical. Russian designer Alexander Rodchenko in 1919 created a set of three monochrome paintings that he titled “Pure Red Color, Pure Yellow Color, and Pure Blue Color”. While beautiful in their own right, the designer used the simplicity of form and historical medium to subvert our appreciation of the work by saying that, with this work, art is essentially done. The gap he found was in representation - that with mechanical reproduction it was no long necessary to paint narrative or figurative pictures. The result is not a wider gap but a closure - of fine art, for now, for then.

> I reduced painting to its logical conclusion and exhibited three canvases: red, blue, yellow,” he declared. “I affirmed: it’s all over. Basic colors. Every plane is a plane and there is to be no more representation.

> - Alexander Rodchenko

Your job as a designer is to create something new and lasting. But it’s equally about creating recognizable change and often that change is found in the gap between experience and expediency, between certainty and contingency, between wholeness and wholesomeness.

Find a gap, twist it open, see what results. Design is both a skill that dictates conformity and an art that demands redirection.
