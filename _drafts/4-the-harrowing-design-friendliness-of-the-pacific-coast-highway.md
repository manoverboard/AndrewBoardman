I’m a pretty experienced driver. Growing up on the East Coast means that you learn to navigate the highways and byways with a bit of panache and more than a little bit of respect for crazy, difficult drivers and crappy road conditions.

The Philadelphia suburbs, where I grew up, has pretty decent (e.g. careful) drivers and well-maintained roads. New England and Upstate New York, where I spent most of my 20s, has excellent roads and truly terrible drivers. New York City and its environs, where I spent most of my 30s, has horrible roads and excellent drivers. (It strikes me that the correlation between road conditions and driver competence is not an exact science — but Philly may be a good mean.)

\#Then there’s the West

California, however, is in a different category altogether. There are probably few places in the world that are more designed around the automobile than the Great State of California. And one of its most famous roadways, the Pacific Coast Highway or Route 1, represents a kind of highway pinnacle, a road that broke the mold for all roads ever built.

I spent a few weeks in California in August and in the middle of our trip, we braved the PCH north from Los Angeles to San Francisco. I know. Most people like to go the opposite direction in order to better take in the  phenomenal scenery. But we went South to North and I’m glad we did.

Imagine this: you’re driving on a single lane, well-paved and well-demarcated highway. On your right are steep cliffs and mountain walls that were blasted about one hundred years ago to make way for your vehicle and the ones behind and in front of you. The flora on those cliffs and mountainsides are painted green and blue and pink and red and brown and orange and rock. Sometimes the precipice on your right is a few feet away. Other times, you can barely see all the way up to the mountainside. On your left, driving north, are even steeper cliffs that drop down to the Pacific Ocean. Way, way down, you can see the foaming, fomenting ocean waves lapping against the shore.

Meanwhile, you’re driving what? 30, 40 miles per hour. Maybe 50 miles per hour. In the occasional split, Maseratis and Mercedes fly past you on the left, their drivers focused entirely on the two lines that separate them from danger and mayhem. And sometimes, you’re driving 20 miles per hour. Hairpin turns drop you down to 15 or even 10 miles per hour. You’re slowing down, speeding up, watching the scenery, and the whole time, you’re hoping that your kid isn’t about to throw up their breakfast. Sometimes there are barriers between cars and cliff.

It was a white knuckle affair for me and I confess that I only had one panic attack (well, maybe two) which I swallowed silently.

But here’s what I found to be most interesting. While the Pacific Coast Highway is imperfectly designed (why not consistently install barriers up for southbound cars?), it struck me that Californian drivers have developed an unwritten law of the road that takes into account all levels of driving experience and willfulness.

Almost no one tailgated me or other drivers. No one passed me in a huff, flooring it to get around the next curve. And when I was driving slowly to take in the scenery, others did as well, giving breathing room to all who followed. 

Along the three hour drive on the PCH, it’s common to get out of your car and take in the scenery at various established (and sometimes makeshift) viewpoints. Minivans pull over to the side of the road and families pile out with their smartphones to take a photo and breath in the ocean mist. Others are just taking a break or having a scenic snack (or recovering from a panic attack). There are people crossing the road every which way, some not so safely.

The point is that these drivers of 4,000 pound steel vehicles navigating the death-defying roadways of the Pacific Coast Highway were calm, patient, and respectful. I did not expect this.

In a culture that is increasingly designed for speed, in which rules for courteousness are often disregarded, and in which sensory experience is devalued, the PCH is a useful and uncodified standard for behaviour. Regardless of what one might think about petroleum-based transportation, that stretch of precarious highway in car-centric California is a model for how we can get somewhere together, separately, while also not running each other off a cliff.
