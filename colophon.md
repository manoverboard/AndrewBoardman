Nothing comes easy â€” even when those things that are easy. There are thousands of people that have directly and indirectly helped make this site, from elementary school teachers to recent friends. Putting a value and weight on the causality of any production is difficult. But, what the hell, and here's a list.

I'm also including a list of software and tools. This is a different site than most, in part because of the technologies behind it.

#### People who made this site:

* [Nikki Wolfe](http://nikkitaylor.ca/) (developer)
* [Daniel Lamb](http://www.quicksheep.com/) (developer)
* [Maeve Boardman](https://twitter.com/maevebrave) (daughter)
* [Me](https://twitter.com/deckchairs) (myself and I)

#### Software and tools used for this site:

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (a static site generator)
* [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) (vector graphics editor)
* [Adobe]() Photoshop and XD (raster and vector graphic editors)
* [Forestry]() (static CMS made in Halifax, Canada)
* [GT Sektra](https://www.grillitype.com/typeface/gt-sectra) and [GT America](http://www.gt-america.com/) typefaces (Grilli Type)
* [Markup language]() (in this case, HTML)
* [Cascading Style Sheets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS) (aka CSS)
