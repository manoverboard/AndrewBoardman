sub-title: This site is entirely my doing. Except for the things that I know about.
description: I founded Manoverboard, a design studio focused on driving social change,
  in 2002 in Brooklyn with the idea of pushing the boundaries of design for innovative
  businesses and nonprofit organizations. Mostly what I do there is design and send
  emails and talk on the phone. I cut my real design teeth designing Barneys New York’s
  first ecommerce site and the nonprofit Acumen’s first visual identity. I hold a
  B.A. from Brown University and and M.F.A from the University at Albany SUNY. I received
  a Fulbright Fellowship and a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship. I worked
  at the The Rockefeller Foundation for many years. I was an instructor at Red River
  College and served as provincial chapter president of Graphic Designers of Canada.

about-content: <blockquote><p>“To see a World in a Grain of Sand <br>And a Heaven
  in a Wild Flower, <br>Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand <br>And Eternity in
  an hour.” <br>—William Blake, <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43650/auguries-of-innocence"
  title="">Augeries of Innocence</a> (c. 1803)</p></blockquote><p>What exists beyond
  our mere shadows? How can we grasp our place in the continuum of history's unfolding
  triumphs and abominable tragedies? What does it mean to design our answers? And
  how do we make our connections and commentaries matter?</p><p>These are some of
  the questions that challenge me and cut across my work and practice.</p><p>Who is
  Andrew Boardman? I manage a design studio called Manoverboard. Our focus is on helping
  organizations drive social change through human-centered design and digital strategy.
  The company began in 2002 out of my apartment in Brooklyn. At Manoverboard, I develop
  strategies to meaningfully connect our clients to audiences through exacting and
  helpful user experience. I am also working to advance a more humane and sustainable
  web that is accessible, equitable and durable. I send a lot of emails.</p><p>I also
  draw and write. I'm developing a book on design responsibility. I recently taught
  design at Red River College. And I write articles and speak on subjects such as
  technology, sustainability and history.</p><p>What else? I cut my teeth by designing
  Barneys New York’s first e-commerce site. I hold a degree from Brown University
  and an M.F.A. from SUNY Albany. I received a Fulbright Fellowship and a NYFA Fellowship.
  I also worked at The Rockefeller Foundation for many years. Today, I live in Winnipeg,
  Canada.</p><p>It took about 13.8 billion years for me to get here. If you desire,
