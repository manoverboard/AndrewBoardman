sub-title: Design averts catastrophe.
description: I founded Manoverboard, a design studio focused on driving social change,
  in 2002 in Brooklyn with the idea of pushing the boundaries of design for innovative
  businesses and nonprofit organizations. Mostly what I do there is design and send
  emails and talk on the phone. I cut my real design teeth designing Barneys New York’s
  first ecommerce site and the nonprofit Acumen’s first visual identity. I hold a
  B.A. from Brown University and and M.F.A from the University at Albany SUNY. I received
  a Fulbright Fellowship and a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship. I worked
  at the The Rockefeller Foundation for many years. I was an instructor at Red River
  College and served as provincial chapter president of Graphic Designers of Canada.

about-content: <blockquote><p>“To see a World in a Grain of Sand <br>And a Heaven
  in a Wild Flower, <br>Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand <br>And Eternity in
  an hour.” <br>—William Blake, <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43650/auguries-of-innocence"
  title="">Augeries of Innocence</a> (c. 1803)</p></blockquote><p>What exists beyond
  our mere shadows? How can we grasp our place in the continuum of history's unfolding
  triumphs and abominable tragedies? What does it mean to design answers? And how
  do we make our connections and commentaries matter?</p><p>These are some of the
  questions that challenge me and cut across my work and practice. I call this site
  "A to B" because it's what I know. (I'm leaving "C to Z" to others.)</p><p>I am
  a designer who runs a studio in Canada called <a href="https://manoverboard.com"
  title="">Manoverboard</a>. Our focus is on helping organizations drive social change
  through human-centered design. Manoverboard began in 2002 out of my Brooklyn apartment.</p><p>In
  addition to managing the studio, I draw and write. I am slowly working on a book
  on design responsibility. I teach at the University of Manitoba and recently taught
  at Red River College in Winnipeg. My primary interests like in subjects such as
  consciousness, history and critical theory.</p><p>What else? I cut my design teeth
  creating Barneys New York’s first e-commerce site. I hold a B.A. from Brown University
  and an M.F.A. from SUNY Albany. I received a Fulbright Fellowship and a NYFA Fellowship.
