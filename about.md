sub-title: Design spells destiny.
description: I founded Manoverboard, a design studio focused on driving social change,
  in 2002 in Brooklyn with the idea of pushing the boundaries of design for innovative
  businesses and nonprofit organizations. Mostly what I do there is design and send
  emails and talk on the phone. I cut my real design teeth designing Barneys New York’s
  first ecommerce site and the nonprofit Acumen’s first visual identity. I hold a
  B.A. from Brown University and and M.F.A from the University at Albany SUNY. I received
  a Fulbright Fellowship and a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship. I worked
  at the The Rockefeller Foundation for many years. I was an instructor at Red River
  College and served as provincial chapter president of Graphic Designers of Canada.

about-content: <blockquote><p>“To see a World in a Grain of Sand <br>And a Heaven
  in a Wild Flower, <br>Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand <br>And Eternity in
  an hour.” <br>—William Blake, <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43650/auguries-of-innocence"
  title="">Augeries of Innocence</a> (c. 1803)</p></blockquote><p>What exists beyond
  our mere shadows? How can we grasp our place in the continuum of history's unfolding
  triumphs and abominable tragedies? What does it mean to design and present new problems
  and new answers? How can we be better stewards of our planet as designers and make
  our work more meaningful for the people and crises to come? How can we better educate
  design students who will bring about and activate these transitions?</p><p>These
  are some of the questions that challenge me and cut across my work and research.
  I call this site "A—B" because it's what I know. (I am leaving "C—Z" to others.)
  This website houses some of my work and meditations on design and its correspondence
  with history, environment, consciousness and theory.</p><p>I am a designer who runs
  a studio in Canada called <a href="https://manoverboard.com" title="">Manoverboard</a>
  whose mission is to help organizations drive social change through design. Manoverboard
  is a Certified B Corporation and serves clients throughout the world. The whole
  shebang began in 2002 out of my Brooklyn apartment.</p><p>In addition to managing
  the studio, I design, draw and write. I am slowly working on a book on design consciousness.
  I teach design at the University of Manitoba and recently taught at Red River College
  in Winnipeg.</p><p>What else? I cut my design teeth creating a website for (now
  shuttered) Barneys New York. I hold a B.A. from Brown University and an M.F.A. from
  SUNY Albany. I received a Fulbright Fellowship and a NYFA Fellowship. I worked at
  The Rockefeller Foundation for a while.</p><p>It took about 13.8 billion years for
  me to get to this sentence. After this next sentence, you might want to <a href="mailto:andrew@manoverboard.com"
  title="email andrew boardman">email me</a>. Looking forward.</p>
meta-description: This is the About page about Andrew Boardman. I design, draw, write
  and teach. Plus I read books. Mostly on graphic design, theory, history, consciousness.
