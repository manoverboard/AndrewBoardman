description: I founded Manoverboard, a design studio focused on driving social change,
  in 2002 in Brooklyn with the idea of pushing the boundaries of design for innovative
  businesses and nonprofit organizations. Mostly what I do there is design and send
  emails and talk on the phone. I cut my real design teeth designing Barneys New York’s
  first ecommerce site and the nonprofit Acumen’s first visual identity. I hold a
  B.A. from Brown University and and M.F.A from the University at Albany SUNY. I received
  a Fulbright Fellowship and a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship. I worked
  at the The Rockefeller Foundation for many years. I was an instructor at Red River
  College and served as provincial chapter president of Graphic Designers of Canada.

about-content: <blockquote><p>“To see a World in a Grain of Sand <br>And a Heaven
  in a Wild Flower, <br>Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand <br>And Eternity in
  an hour.” <br>—William Blake, <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43650/auguries-of-innocence"
  title="">Augeries of Innocence</a> (c. 1803)</p></blockquote><p>What exists beyond
  our mere shadows? How can we grasp our place in the continuum of history's unfolding
  triumphs and abominable tragedies? What does it mean to design answers? And how
  do we make our connections and commentaries matter?</p><p>These are some of the
  questions that challenge me and cut across my work and practice. I call this site
  "A to B" because it's what I know. I'm leaving "C to Z" to others.</p><p>Who is
  Andrew Boardman? I am a designer, managing a studio in Canada called <a href="https://manoverboard.com"
  title="">Manoverboard</a>. Our focus is on helping organizations drive social change
  through human-centered design and long-term digital strategy. The company began
  in 2002 out of my apartment in Brooklyn. In all cases, my objective is to advance
  a more humane and sustainable web that is accessible, equitable and durable. I send
  a lot of emails.</p><p>I also draw and write. I'm developing a book on design responsibility.
  I recently taught design at Red River College. And I write articles and speak on
  subjects such as technology, authoritarianism and sustainability.</p><p>What else?
  I cut my teeth designing Barneys New York’s first e-commerce site. I hold a B.A.
  from Brown University and an M.F.A. from SUNY Albany. I received a Fulbright Fellowship
  and a NYFA Fellowship. I worked at The Rockefeller Foundation for many years. Today,
  I live in Winnipeg, Canada with my wife, daughter, and three black cats.</p><p>It
  took about 13.8 billion years for me to get to this sentence. If you desire, please
  go ahead and <a href="mailto:andrew@manoverboard.com" title="email andrew boardman">email
  me</a>.</p>
