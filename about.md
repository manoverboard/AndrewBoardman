sub-title: This site is entirely my doing. Except for some things.
description: I founded Manoverboard, a design studio focused on driving social change,
  in 2002 in Brooklyn with the idea of pushing the boundaries of design for innovative
  businesses and nonprofit organizations. Mostly what I do there is design and send
  emails and talk on the phone. I cut my real design teeth designing Barneys New York’s
  first ecommerce site and the nonprofit Acumen’s first visual identity. I hold a
  B.A. from Brown University and and M.F.A from the University at Albany SUNY. I received
  a Fulbright Fellowship and a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship. I worked
  at the The Rockefeller Foundation for many years. I was an instructor at Red River
  College and served as provincial chapter president of Graphic Designers of Canada.

about-content: <blockquote><p>“To see a World in a Grain of Sand <br>And a Heaven
  in a Wild Flower, <br>Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand <br>And Eternity in
  an hour.” <br>-William Blake, <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43650/auguries-of-innocence"
  title="">Augeries of Innocence</a> (c. 1803) </p></blockquote><p>What exists beyond
  our mere shadows? How is the infinite reflected in the continuum of history's unfolding
  triumphs and tragedies? How do we design our own answers? These are the questions
  that challenge me in my work and my practice. </p><p>Who am I? I manage a design
  studio called Manoverboard. We focus on helping drive social change through human-centered
  design and digital strategy. The business started in 2002 out of my apartment in
  Brooklyn. At Manoverboard, I design interfaces, plan projects and send a lot of
  emails. In my spare time, I draw and write. I'm developing a book on design responsibility.
  I recently taught design at Red River College. And I have a family that I adore.
  </p><p>What else? I cut my teeth designing Barneys New York’s first e-commerce site.
  I have a degree from Brown University and an MFA from SUNY Albany. I also received
  a Fulbright Fellowship and a NYFA Fellowship. I also worked at The Rockefeller Foundation
  for many years. Today, I live in Winnipeg, Canada. </p><p>It took 13.8 billion years
  for me to get here. Go ahead and <a href="mailto:andrew@manoverboard.com" title="">email
