description: I founded Manoverboard, a design studio focused on driving social change,
  in 2002 in Brooklyn with the idea of pushing the boundaries of design for innovative
  businesses and nonprofit organizations. Mostly what I do there is design and send
  emails and talk on the phone. I cut my real design teeth designing Barneys New York’s
  first ecommerce site and the nonprofit Acumen’s first visual identity. I hold a
  B.A. from Brown University and and M.F.A from the University at Albany SUNY. I received
  a Fulbright Fellowship and a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship. I worked
  at the The Rockefeller Foundation for many years. I was an instructor at Red River
  College and served as provincial chapter president of Graphic Designers of Canada.

about-content: “To see a World in a Grain of Sand<br>And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,<br>Hold
  Infinity in the palm of your hand<br>And Eternity in an hour.”<br>-William Blake,
  <em>Augeries of Innocence</em> (c. 1803)<br><br>What exists beyond our mere shadows?
  How is the infinite reflected in the continuum of history's unfolding triumphs and
  tragedies? How do we design our own answers? These are the questions that challenge
  me in my work and my practice.<br><br>Who am I? I manage a design studio called
  Manoverboard. We focus on helping  drive social change through human-centered design
  and digital strategy. The business started in 2002 out of my apartment in Brooklyn.
  At Manoverboard, I design interfaces, plan projects and send a lot of emails.<br><br>What
  else? I cut my teeth designing Barneys New York’s first e-commerce site. I have
  a degree from Brown University and an MFA from SUNY Albany. I also received a Fulbright
  Fellowship and a NYFA Fellowship. I also worked at The Rockefeller Foundation for
  many years.<br><br>Today, I live in Winnipeg, Canada. It took 13.8 billion years
  for me to get here.<br><br>You can contact me at <a href="mailto:andrew@manoverboard.com"
