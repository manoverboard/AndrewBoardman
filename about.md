sub-title: This site is about me and my work. It is entirely my doing. Except for
  some things.
description: I founded Manoverboard, a design studio focused on driving social change,
  in 2002 in Brooklyn with the idea of pushing the boundaries of design for innovative
  businesses and nonprofit organizations. Mostly what I do there is design and send
  emails and talk on the phone. I cut my real design teeth designing Barneys New York’s
  first ecommerce site and the nonprofit Acumen’s first visual identity. I hold a
  B.A. from Brown University and and M.F.A from the University at Albany SUNY. I received
  a Fulbright Fellowship and a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship. I worked
  at the The Rockefeller Foundation for many years. I was an instructor at Red River
  College and served as provincial chapter president of Graphic Designers of Canada.
